      <h2>About the Game</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Cash Catcher</strong> is a satirical game that visualizes political donations during the 2024 U.S. presidential campaign.
        By collecting falling “donations” from billionaire donors, players confront how disproportionate wealth influences political momentum.
      </p>
      <p>
        The player’s win is intentionally ironic — collecting millions in seconds reflects a reality that’s both outrageous and normalized.

      <h2>Why Elon Musk?</h2>
      <p>
        Elon Musk was chosen as a symbolic donor due to his high-profile political commentary, corporate influence, and wealth.
        This character represents the blurred line between private interests and public leadership in today’s politics.

  <h2>Fact Spotlight</h2>
  <p>
    By the end of Trump's presidential campaign, <strong>Elon Musk had spent $277 million</strong> to elect Trump and allied Republicans — 
    making him the largest individual political donor of the 2024 election and the largest since at least 2010 
    (outside of self-funded candidates). His donations primarily went to his super PAC, <em>America PAC</em>.
